","Thought:
The context states that a reasonable education system requires everyone to have the right to compulsory education and access to higher education through fair competition.
- Option A suggests that not allowing everyone to go to college makes an education system unreasonable. However, the context specifies access to higher education through fair competition, not guaranteed access for everyone, so this is not necessarily unreasonable.
- Option B suggests that guaranteeing compulsory education makes an education system reasonable. While compulsory education is a requirement, the context also requires fair access to higher education, so this alone does not make the system reasonable.
- Option C states that not allowing everyone to enjoy compulsory education makes an education system unreasonable. This aligns with the context, as compulsory education is a requirement for a reasonable system.
- Option D suggests more requirements are needed, but the context already specifies two key requirements for reasonableness.

","Choices:
  A: F or M
  C: L or N
  B: G or L
  D: M or N
","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the speakers according to the given conditions:
1. There are 6 speakers: F, G, J, L, M, N.
2. Three speakers speak before lunch, and three speak after lunch.
3. G must speak before lunch.
4. Only one speaker is between M and N.
5. F speaks in the first or third place.
6. J is the fourth speaker.
Let's analyze the conditions:
- Since J is the fourth speaker, the order is: \_ \_ \_ J \_ \_.
- G must speak before lunch, so G must be in one of the first three positions.
- F must be in the first or third position.
- Only one speaker is between M and N, so they must be in positions like (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), or (4, 6).
Let's consider the possibilities:
1. **F in the first position:**
   - Order: F \_ \_ J \_ \_
   - G must be in the second or third position.
   - If G is second: F G \_ J \_ \_
     - M and N must be in positions (3, 5) or (5, 3).
     - If M is third, N is fifth: F G M J N \_
     - If N is third, M is fifth: F G N J M \_
   - If G is third: F \_ G J \_ \_
     - M and N must be in positions (2, 4) or (4, 6).

2. **F in the third position:**
   - Order: \_ \_ F J \_ \_
   - G must be in the first or second position.
   - If G is first: G \_ F J \_ \_
     - M and N must be in positions (2, 4) or (4, 6).
     - M cannot be fourth because J is fourth.
     - If M is second, N is fourth: G M F J N \_ (invalid because J is fourth)

  D: Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.
","To determine which choice cannot weaken the argument, we need to analyze each option in relation to the argument's structure:
1. **Argument Structure:**
   - Premise 1: The government's function is to meet the real needs of the people.
   - Premise 2: The government cannot meet those needs unless it knows what they are.
   - Premise 3: Freedom of expression ensures government officials hear demand messages.
   - Conclusion: Therefore, free speech is essential for a healthy country.
2. **Analysis of Choices:**
   - **A:** ""In most cases, the people do not know what they really need.""
     - This weakens the argument by suggesting that even if the government hears demands, those demands may not reflect real needs.
   
   - **B:** ""Free speech ultimately tends to disrupt social order, and good social order is a prerequisite for meeting the needs of the masses.""
     - This weakens the argument by suggesting that free speech could hinder the government's ability to meet needs due to social disruption.
   
   - **C:** ""The legitimate function of the government is not to satisfy the needs of the people, but to provide equal opportunities for the people.""
     - This weakens the argument by challenging the premise that the government's role is to meet needs directly.
   
   - **D:** ""Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.""
     - This weakens the argument by suggesting that free speech alone is not enough and that social order is also necessary.
3. **Conclusion:**
   - All options except one weaken the argument by challenging its premises or conclusion.
   - **A** cannot weaken the argument because it does not directly challenge the necessity of free speech for the government to know the people's needs; it only suggests that people might not know their needs, which does not negate the role of free speech in communicating whatever demands exist.

4. Only when you cross the I peak can you reach Lake J.
The team does not go to I Peak. According to condition 4, if they don't go to I Peak, they cannot visit Lake J. Therefore, they must visit Lake G to satisfy condition 1 (at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited).

  A: The sales department is on the upper level of the R & D department
  B: The sales department is one level above the administrative department
  C: The sales department is at the next level of the planning department
  D: Sales Department is on the second floor
","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine the possible arrangement of the departments across the 6 floors.
1. **Condition 1**: The Human Resources (HR) and Sales departments are not adjacent.
2. **Condition 2**: The Finance department is on the next floor above the Planning department.
3. **Condition 3**: The Administration department is above the Planning department but below the HR department.
4. **Additional Condition**: HR is not above the Administration department.
Let's denote the floors from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and 6 the highest.
### Step-by-step Analysis:
- **Condition 2** implies**: Planning (P) is directly below Finance (F), so they must be on consecutive floors: (P, F).
- **Condition 3** implies**: Administration (A) is above Planning (P) but below HR. So, the order must be: P < A < HR.
- **Additional Condition**: HR is not above Administration, so HR must be above A but not directly above it.
Given these conditions, let's explore possible placements:
1. **Possible order for P, A, HR**: 
   - P < A < HR
   - Since HR is not directly above A, there must be at least one floor between A and HR.
2. **Possible placements for P and F**:
   - Since F is directly above P, they must be consecutive.
3. **Possible placements for HR and Sales**:
   - HR and Sales cannot be adjacent.
### Possible Arrangements:
Let's try to place these departments:
- Assume P is on floor 1, then F is on floor 2.
- A must be above P, so A could be on floor 3.
- HR must be above A, so HR could be on floor 5 (since it cannot be directly above A on floor 4).
- Sales cannot be adjacent to HR, so Sales cannot be on floor 4 or 6. Sales could be on floor 3 or 1, but since A is on 3 and P is on 1, Sales must be on floor 4.
- R&D can be placed on the remaining floor, which is floor 6.
This gives us a possible arrangement:
1. Planning (P)
2. Finance (F)
3. Administration (A)
4. Sales
5. Human Resources (HR)
6. Research and Development (R&D)
### Verification:
- HR and Sales are not adjacent (Condition 1).
- Finance is directly above Planning (Condition 2).
- Administration is above Planning but below HR (Condition 3).
- HR is not directly above Administration (Additional Condition).
### Evaluating Choices:
- **A**: Sales is on floor 4, R&D is on floor 6. Sales is not above R&D.
- **B**: Sales is on floor 4, Administration is on floor 3. Sales is above Administration.

","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given conditions step-by-step:
1. **Condition 1**: Among the 4 men, there are 3 tall men, 2 doctors, and 1 is handsome.
2. **Condition 2**: Wang Wei and Wu Gang are both doctors.
3. **Condition 3**: Liu Dawei and Li Qiang are the same height.
4. **Condition 4**: Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall.
Let's deduce the possibilities:
- **Doctors**: From Condition 2, Wang Wei and Wu Gang are doctors. Since there are only 2 doctors, Liu Dawei and Li Qiang cannot be doctors.
- **Tall Men**: There are 3 tall men. From Condition 4, Li Qiang and Wang Wei are not both tall. This means:
  - If Wang Wei is tall, Li Qiang is not tall.
  - If Li Qiang is tall, Wang Wei is not tall.
- **Handsome**: Only 1 man is handsome.
Now, let's analyze each person:
- **Wang Wei**: 
  - Doctor (from Condition 2).
  - If Wang Wei is tall, then Li Qiang is not tall (from Condition 4).
  - Cannot be handsome because if Wang Wei is handsome, then there would be no one left to be the only handsome person if another condition contradicts it.
- **Wu Gang**:
  - Doctor (from Condition 2).
  - Could be tall (since there are 3 tall men and he is not restricted by Condition 4).
  - Cannot be handsome because if Wu Gang is handsome, then there would be no one left to be the only handsome person if another condition contradicts it.
- **Li Qiang**:
  - Not a doctor.
  - If Li Qiang is tall, Wang Wei is not tall (from Condition 4).
  - Liu Dawei is the same height as Li Qiang (from Condition 3), so if Li Qiang is tall, Liu Dawei is also tall.
  - Could be handsome.
- **Liu Dawei**:
  - Not a doctor.
  - Same height as Li Qiang (from Condition 3).
  - If Li Qiang is tall, Liu Dawei is tall.
  - Could be handsome.
Now, let's determine who meets all conditions (tall, handsome, doctor):
- **Wang Wei**: Doctor, possibly tall, but cannot be handsome.
- **Wu Gang**: Doctor, possibly tall, but cannot be handsome.
- **Li Qiang**: Not a doctor, possibly tall, possibly handsome.
- **Liu Dawei**: Not a doctor, possibly tall (if Li Qiang is tall), possibly handsome.
Since there are 3 tall men and Li Qiang and Liu Dawei are the same height, if Li Qiang is not tall, Liu Dawei is not tall, leaving Wang Wei, Wu Gang, and one more man as tall. If Li Qiang is tall, then Liu Dawei is tall, and Wang Wei cannot be tall (from Condition 4), making Wu Gang the third tall man.
Thus, the only configuration that fits all conditions is:
- Wang Wei: Tall, Doctor
- Wu Gang: Tall, Doctor
- Li Qiang: Tall, Handsome
- Liu Dawei: Not Tall, Not Doctor
Therefore, Li Qiang is the only one who can be tall, handsome, and not a doctor, fitting the requirement of being the only handsome person.

","Thought:
The problem involves understanding the logical implications of the statements ""Money is like dung"" and ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars."" The absurd conclusion ""friends are like dung"" arises from combining these statements. To avoid this conclusion, we need to analyze the logical structure.
1. ""Money is like dung"" implies that money is worthless.
2. ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars"" implies that friends have significant value.
If we combine these:
- If money is worthless (like dung), and friends are worth a lot of money, then by substitution, friends would be like dung, which is absurd.
To avoid this absurdity, at least one of the premises must be false or the logical structure must be flawed.

A: The expression ""money is like dung"" is false.
- This could prevent the absurd conclusion, but it's not the only way to avoid it.
B: If a friend is indeed worth a lot of money, then money is not like dung.
- This directly addresses the logical flaw. If money is not like dung, then the substitution leading to ""friends are like dung"" is invalid.
C: The statement that ""friends are valuable"" is true.
- This is consistent with ""Friends are worth a thousand dollars,"" but it doesn't address the logical flaw directly.

- Condition 2 states that if E is selected, then A and B must also be selected. This implies that selecting E would require selecting at least three people (A, B, and E), which violates the maximum of 2 people condition unless E is not selected.
Given these conditions, let's analyze:
- If E is selected, A and B must also be selected, which already makes 3 people. This violates the maximum of 2 people condition unless E is not selected.
- Since at least one person of Bingding must be selected, Ding must be selected.
- If Ding is selected, we can select one more person without violating the maximum of 2 people condition.
Therefore, E cannot be selected because selecting E would require selecting A and B, exceeding the maximum of 2 people condition.
Thus, E is not in the selection of four people.

  - Li is with Tianshu, but Liu cannot be with Tianshu (from condition 3), so this cannot be correct.

- Option D highlights that China's tax system is dominated by commodity taxes, suggesting that people pay taxes through consumption, which indirectly challenges the notion that income tax is the primary way to gain the honor of being a taxpayer.
The statement that most directly raises doubts about the official's argument is Option B, as it directly addresses the issue of honor in relation to low personal income tax.

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the constraints and determine which pairs of employees cannot be assigned to the sales department.
1. **Constraints:**
   - H and Y must be in the same department.
   - F and G cannot be in the same department.
   - If X is in sales, W must be in production.
   - F must be in production.
2. **Department Assignments:**
   - 1 person in public relations.
   - 3 people in production.
   - 3 people in sales.
3. **Analysis:**
   - F is in production.
   - G cannot be in production (since F is there).
   - H and Y must be together, so they can either be in production or sales.
   - If X is in sales, W must be in production.
4. **Evaluating Each Pair:**
   - **A: G and I**
     - G cannot be in production, so G could be in sales or public relations.
     - I has no restrictions, so G and I could both be in sales.
   - **B: G and X**
     - G cannot be in production, so G could be in sales or public relations.
     - X can be in sales, but if X is in sales, W must be in production.
     - G and X can both be in sales.
   - **C: G and Y**
     - G cannot be in production, so G could be in sales or public relations.
     - Y must be with H, so if Y is in sales, H is also in sales.
     - G and Y can both be in sales.
   - **D: H and W**
     - H and Y must be together.
     - If H is in sales, Y is also in sales.
     - If W is in sales, X cannot be in sales (since W is not in production).
     - H and W cannot both be in sales because if H is in sales, Y is also in sales, and W would need to be in production if X is in sales.
Therefore, the pair that is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department is:

   - Only companies with dividends can issue new stocks.
   - If a company has a dividend, it does not need funds.

","To evaluate the argument that more wealthy Chinese are transferring their property abroad, we need to consider the evidence provided: the increase in transaction volume by mainland Chinese buyers in the US real estate market.
Let's analyze the choices:
- **Choice ?:** This choice suggests that although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year. This could imply that the increase in transaction volume is due to higher prices per transaction rather than an increase in the number of buyers. This would weaken the argument that more wealthy Chinese are transferring property abroad, as it suggests the same number of buyers are spending more.
- **Choice C:** This choice mentions real estate speculators among wealthy Chinese in Beijing and Shanghai. While it provides context about the behavior of wealthy Chinese, it doesn't directly address the argument about transferring property abroad.
- **Choice D:** This choice discusses the risk and value preservation of the US real estate market. It doesn't directly counter the argument about the number of wealthy Chinese transferring property abroad.
The best argument against the claim that more wealthy Chinese are transferring property abroad is that the increase in transaction volume could be due to higher prices rather than an increase in the number of buyers.

  C: I was assigned to the sales department.
  D: W is assigned to the public relations department.
","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions and determine which statement cannot be true if X and F are assigned to the same department.
Given:
1. H and Y must be in the same department.
2. F and G cannot be in the same department.
3. If X is in the sales department, W is in the production department.
4. F must be in the production department.
If X and F are in the same department, then they must both be in the production department because F must be in production (condition 4).
Let's analyze each choice:
A: G is assigned to the sales department.
- If F is in production, G cannot be in production (condition 2). G can be in sales, so this is possible.
B: H is assigned to the production department.
- If H is in production, Y must also be in production (condition 1). This is possible.
C: I was assigned to the sales department.
- There are no restrictions on I, so I can be in sales. This is possible.
D: W is assigned to the public relations department.
- If X is in production (since X and F are in the same department), there is no condition forcing W to be in production. However, if W is in public relations, then X cannot be in sales (condition 3), which is consistent with X being in production. But, since F is in production and X is with F, there are only two spots left in production, and W cannot be in production. This leaves only one spot in production for either H or Y, which means the other must be in public relations. This configuration is possible, but let's check further.
Since F and X are in production, and H and Y must be together, they can only be in public relations or sales. If H and Y are in public relations, W can be in public relations, leaving sales for G and I. If H and Y are in sales, W must be in production, which contradicts W being in public relations.
Thus, if W is in public relations, H and Y must be in sales, leaving no room for W in production, which is consistent with W being in public relations. However, this configuration leaves no room for G in production, forcing G into sales, which is possible.
Upon re-evaluation, the critical point is that if W is in public relations, H and Y must be in sales, leaving no room for G in production, which is consistent with G being in sales. Therefore, all configurations are possible except for the scenario where W is in public relations and H and Y are not in sales, which is not possible.

The statement establishes a relationship between cost and profit: high cost leads to low profit, and high profit leads to low cost. It also distinguishes between wages (cost) and profit (not cost).

- Option B suggests no conflict if employees hold shares, but the statement doesn't address shareholding or conflicts.
- Option C suggests conflict if employees don't hold shares, but again, the statement doesn't mention shares or conflicts.
- Option D suggests the boss always makes more money, but the statement doesn't provide information about absolute amounts of money earned by the boss versus employees.
The statement focuses on the relationship between cost and profit, not on shareholding or conflicts of interest. Therefore, none of the options directly follow from the given information about cost and profit.
However, the statement implies that the interests of the boss and employees might be aligned or misaligned based on cost and profit dynamics. If employees are part of the cost, reducing costs (and thus increasing profit) might not align with their wage interests. Conversely, if costs are high (wages are high), profits are low, which might not align with the boss's interest in maximizing profit.
Option C is the most relevant because it suggests a potential conflict of interest when employees don't have a stake in the enterprise (i.e., no shares), aligning with the idea that high wages (cost) reduce profit, which might not align with the boss's interest.

1. There are six assistants: F, G, H, I, M, and P.
2. There are three departments, each with three assistants.

6. H and I are not in charge of the same department.
7. F and M are not in charge of the same department.
We need to determine which statement must be true given these conditions.
Let's consider the implications:
- Since only one assistant can be in charge of all three departments, let's assume that assistant is X. This means X is in all three departments, and the other five assistants (F, G, H, I, M, P) are distributed among the departments such that each department has three assistants.
- F and G cannot be in the same department, so they must be in different departments.
- H and I cannot be in the same department, so they must be in different departments.
- F and M cannot be in the same department, so they must be in different departments.
Now, let's analyze the choices:
A: F and H are in charge of the same department.
- There is no direct restriction preventing F and H from being in the same department. This is possible but not necessary.
B: F and I are in charge of the same department.
- There is no direct restriction preventing F and I from being in the same department. This is possible but not necessary.
C: I and P are in charge of the same department.
- There is no direct restriction preventing I and P from being in the same department. This is possible but not necessary.
D: M and G are in charge of the same department.
- Since F and M cannot be in the same department, and F and G cannot be in the same department, M and G must be in the same department to satisfy the condition that each department has three assistants.

3. There was a significant outflow of deposits, and the proportion of time deposits decreased.
Let's analyze each choice:
- **A**: This suggests that residents are holding onto their funds to buy goods due to rising prices. While this explains why funds are not being deposited, it doesn't explain why they are flowing out of the banks.
- **B**: This suggests that residents are holding onto their funds in anticipation of higher bank interest rates. This would likely lead to an increase in deposits, not a decrease.
- **C**: This suggests that private enterprises are tight on funds due to controlled loan scales, leading to active private lending with higher interest rates than bank deposits. This provides a strong incentive for residents to move their funds from low-interest bank deposits to higher-interest private lending.
- **D**: This suggests that residents are considering investing in stocks or funds due to low bank deposit interest rates. While this could explain some outflow, it doesn't directly address the significant outflow of 100 billion yuan.

Given that G is the northernmost island, the arrangement starts with G. Let's analyze the possibilities:

   - G is in team 1, so G must be in the front of team 1.
2. **Condition 3**: If L is scheduled to play, he must be on team 1.
   - L must be in team 1 if he is playing.
3. **Condition 4**: Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.
   - If N is in team 1, neither P nor K can be in team 1.
4. **Condition 5**: P cannot be in the same team as Q.
   - If P is in team 1, Q cannot be in team 1, and vice versa.
5. **Condition 6**: If H is in team 2, Q is in the middle of team 1.
   - This condition is relevant only if H is in team 2.
Now, let's evaluate each choice:
- **Choice A: K and L**
  - L must be in team 1.
  - If K is in team 1, N cannot be in team 1 (Condition 4).
  - This choice is possible if N is not in team 1.
- **Choice B: K and P**
  - If K is in team 1, N cannot be in team 1 (Condition 4).
  - If P is in team 1, Q cannot be in team 1 (Condition 5).
  - This choice is possible if N and Q are not in team 1.
- **Choice C: L and N**
  - L must be in team 1.
  - If N is in team 1, neither P nor K can be in team 1 (Condition 4).
  - This choice is possible if P and K are not in team 1.
- **Choice D: L and Q**
  - L must be in team 1.
  - If Q is in team 1, P cannot be in team 1 (Condition 5).
  - This choice is possible if P is not in team 1.
Since L must be in team 1 if he is playing, we need to find a pair that includes L and satisfies all conditions. 
- **Choice A: K and L** is possible if N is not in team 1.
- **Choice C: L and N** is possible if P and K are not in team 1.
- **Choice D: L and Q** is possible if P is not in team 1.
Considering all conditions, **Choice C: L and N** is the most straightforward pair that satisfies all conditions without additional restrictions on other magicians.

","Choices:
  A: Tang Xiaohua
  B: Peng Youwen

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the constraints and the selection process:
1. **Girls Selection**: We need to select 2 out of 3 girls: Fang Rufen, Guo Yanran, and He Zhilian. If He Zhilian is not selected, we must select Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran.
2. **Boys Selection**: We need to select 3 out of 5 boys: Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, Song Wenkai, and Tang Xiaohua.
3. **Constraints**:
   - Guo Yanran and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together.
   - Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together.
   - Qiu Zhijie and Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected together.
Given that He Zhilian is not selected, we have already chosen Fang Rufen and Guo Yanran as the girls. According to constraint 1, Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected because Guo Yanran is selected.
Now, let's consider the boys:
- Since Tang Xiaohua cannot be selected, we don't need to worry about constraints involving him (constraints 1 and 3).
- We need to select 3 boys from Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, Ren Xiangyang, and Song Wenkai.
Considering constraint 2 (Peng Youwen and Song Wenkai cannot be selected together), we have two scenarios:
- Select Peng Youwen, Qiu Zhijie, and Ren Xiangyang.
- Select Song Wenkai, Qiu Zhijie, and Ren Xiangyang.
In both scenarios, Qiu Zhijie is selected. Therefore, Qiu Zhijie is always selected when He Zhilian is not selected.
Thus, the person who is not selected when He Zhilian is not selected is Tang Xiaohua.

The view suggests that online shopping allows people in regions with low economic development to satisfy their material desires. To question this view, we need to identify a choice that challenges the idea that online shopping effectively meets these desires.
- Choice A discusses taxes and fees, which is more about economic implications rather than questioning the ability to satisfy material desires.
- Choice B refers to the pre-Internet era, which doesn't directly challenge the current effectiveness of online shopping.
- Choice C points out that online displays may not fully reflect reality, which could question the satisfaction derived from online shopping.
- Choice D suggests that satisfaction depends solely on economic development, challenging the idea that online shopping alone can satisfy material desires regardless of economic conditions.
The choice that most directly questions the view is D, as it implies that economic development is the primary factor in satisfying material desires, not online shopping.

3. Therefore, Taiwanese are not Chinese.
To show that this argument is not valid, we need to find a reasoning pattern that similarly leads to an invalid conclusion.
- Option A: This reasoning is invalid because it incorrectly assumes that not being a successful person means not having to eat in clothes, which is unrelated to the criteria for success.
- Option B: This reasoning is invalid because it assumes that having use value automatically makes something a commodity, which is not necessarily true.
- Option C: This reasoning is valid because it follows logically that if all technical backbones study hard and Xiao Zhang is a technical backbone, then Xiao Zhang studies hard.
- Option D: This reasoning is valid because it logically follows that if all criminal behaviors are illegal and should be condemned, then all criminal behaviors should be condemned.

","To solve this problem, let's analyze the conditions and the given scenario:
1. **Printing Group Members**: G, H, L (3 members).
2. **Conditions**:
   - Each group must have at least 3 employees.
   - F and K cannot be in the same group.
   - If K is in a group, J must also be in that group.
   - M must be in at least one of the groups.
   - At least one employee must be in both groups.
3. **Objective**: Maximize the number of common members between the two groups.
Given that the printing group has G, H, and L, let's determine the possible members of the binding group:
- **Common Members**: To maximize common members, we should try to include G, H, or L in the binding group.
- **M's Inclusion**: M must be in at least one group. To maximize common members, include M in the binding group.
- **F and K's Condition**: If K is in the binding group, J must also be included. F and K cannot be together, so if K is included, F cannot be.
- **Minimum Members**: The binding group must have at least 3 members.
Let's construct the binding group:
- Start with common members: G, H, L, and M (to satisfy M's condition).
- Check if we can add more members while satisfying all conditions.
Possible binding group: G, H, L, M (4 members, 3 common).
Now, let's verify the conditions:
- **Condition 1**: Both groups have at least 3 members.
- **Condition 2**: F and K are not in the same group. Neither F nor K is in the binding group.
- **Condition 3**: K is not in the binding group, so J's inclusion is not required.
- **Condition 4**: M is in the binding group.
- **Condition 5**: G, H, and L are common members.
The binding group has 4 members (G, H, L, M), and the printing group has 3 members (G, H, L). They share 3 common members.

Now, let's see if any of these roles can overlap:
- **Father's brother-in-law** and **Brother-in-law's father**: If Mr. Chen's father's brother-in-law is his father's wife's brother, then this person could also be Mr. Chen's brother-in-law's father if Mr. Chen's brother-in-law is his sibling's husband. In this case, they refer to the same person.

1. **Condition 1**: If paper E is used, then paper F cannot be used, but paper K must be used.
2. **Condition 2**: Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J.
3. **Condition 3**: If you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K.
4. **Condition 4**: Essay E is a manuscript requested by a celebrity and cannot be used.
From Condition 4, we know that paper E cannot be used. Let's see what this implies:
- Since paper E cannot be used, Condition 1 does not apply. Therefore, there is no restriction on paper F, and paper K is not required by this condition.
Now, let's consider the implications of the other conditions:
- **Condition 2**: Paper G or paper H can only be used without paper J. This means if either G or H is used, J cannot be used.
- **Condition 3**: If you don't need thesis G, you don't need thesis K. This implies that if G is not used, K cannot be used either.
Given that E cannot be used, let's evaluate the choices:
- **Choice A**: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used. This cannot be true because E cannot be used.
- **Choice B**: Both articles G and H are used. If both G and H are used, then by Condition 2, J cannot be used. This is possible, but not necessarily required by the conditions.
- **Choice C**: No paper J, but paper K. If J is not used, then G or H can be used (Condition 2). However, if G is not used, K cannot be used (Condition 3). Therefore, for K to be used, G must be used. This is possible but not necessarily required.
- **Choice D**: Both G and J articles are unnecessary. If G is unnecessary, then by Condition 3, K is also unnecessary. If J is unnecessary, then G or H can be used (Condition 2). However, if G is unnecessary, K is unnecessary, which aligns with the conditions.
Given the analysis, the only choice that must be true based on the conditions is:
**Choice D**: Both G and J articles are unnecessary.

  A: Hu Yao is standing on the east side;
  B: Fuyi is standing in the west;
  C: Yinling is standing on the east side;
  D: Leek standing on the west side;
","To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and deduce the positions of the stations:
1. **Fuyi Station** is east of Haoyun Station and west of Huyao Station, and is adjacent to Huyao Station. This implies the order: Haoyun, Fuyi, Huyao.
2. **Jiushang Station** is adjacent to Yinling Station.
3. **Jiushang Station** is adjacent to Haoyun Station and east of Haoyun Station. This implies the order: Haoyun, Jiushang.
Combining these pieces of information:
- Since Jiushang is adjacent to Haoyun and east of it, and Fuyi is also east of Haoyun, Jiushang must be east of Fuyi. Therefore, the order becomes: Haoyun, Fuyi, Jiushang.
- Since Jiushang is adjacent to Yinling, and Jiushang is east of Fuyi, Yinling must be either west of Haoyun or east of Jiushang.
- Given the order Haoyun, Fuyi, Jiushang, and knowing Jiushang is adjacent to Yinling, Yinling must be east of Jiushang.
Thus, the order from west to east is: Haoyun, Fuyi, Jiushang, Yinling, Huyao.
From this order, we can conclude:
- **Huyao** is on the east side.
- **Yinling** is on the east side.

   - If K is treated by a doctor, that doctor must also treat G, H, I (a female).
Now, let's evaluate each choice:
- **A: Doctor F is responsible for treatment.**
  - There is no doctor named F, so this choice is irrelevant.
- **C: J is treated by Dr. Zhang.**
  - J is a male child, so if Dr. Zhang treats J, he must also treat another male (E or F) due to condition 3.

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions given and apply them to the scenario where H is in Team 2.
1. **Condition 6**: If H is in Team 2, Q must be in the middle of Team 1.
2. **Condition 2**: If K is scheduled to play, he must be in the middle.
3. **Condition 3**: If L is scheduled to play, he must be on Team 1.
4. **Condition 4**: Neither P nor K can be in the same team as N.
5. **Condition 5**: P cannot be in the same team as Q.
Now, let's evaluate each option for Team 1:
- **Option A**: Before? L, Middle? Q, After? N
  - L is in Team 1 (satisfies Condition 3).
  - Q is in the middle (satisfies Condition 6).
  - N is in Team 1, so K cannot be in Team 1 (satisfies Condition 4).
  - No P in Team 1, so Condition 5 is satisfied.
  - This arrangement is possible.
- **Option B**: Before? G, Middle? K, After? N
  - Q is not in the middle, violating Condition 6.
  - This arrangement is not possible.
- **Option C**: Before? L, Middle? Q, After? G
  - L is in Team 1 (satisfies Condition 3).
  - Q is in the middle (satisfies Condition 6).
  - No N in Team 1, so Condition 4 is satisfied.
  - No P in Team 1, so Condition 5 is satisfied.
  - This arrangement is possible.
- **Option D**: Before? G, Middle? K, After? L
  - Q is not in the middle, violating Condition 6.
