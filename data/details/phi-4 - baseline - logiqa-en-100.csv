  D: There should be more requirements for a reasonable education system.
","Thought:
The context states that a reasonable education system requires everyone to have the right to compulsory education and access to higher education through fair competition.
- Option A suggests that not allowing everyone to go to college makes an education system unreasonable. However, the context specifies access to higher education through fair competition, not guaranteed access for everyone, so this is not necessarily unreasonable.
- Option B suggests that guaranteeing compulsory education makes an education system reasonable. While compulsory education is a requirement, the context also requires fair access to higher education, so this alone does not make the system reasonable.
- Option C states that not allowing everyone to enjoy compulsory education makes an education system unreasonable. This aligns with the context, as compulsory education is a requirement for a reasonable system.
- Option D suggests more requirements are needed, but the context already specifies two key requirements for reasonableness.

3. Chessman B applauded Chessman C, which might suggest respect or acknowledgment of C's skill, but it doesn't provide a direct indication of C's performance relative to A.
4. Since all players are of equal strength, past performance (A defeating B) does not necessarily predict future outcomes against a different player (C).

Choices:
  A: F or M
  C: L or N
  B: G or L
  D: M or N
","Choices:
  A: F or M
  C: L or N
  B: G or L
  D: M or N
","To solve this problem, we need to arrange the speakers according to the given conditions:
1. There are 6 speakers: F, G, J, L, M, and N.
2. Three speakers speak before lunch, and three speak after lunch.
3. G must speak before lunch.
4. Only one speaker is between M and N.
5. F speaks in the first or third place.
6. J is the fourth speaker.
Let's analyze the conditions:
- Since J is the fourth speaker, the order is: \[ \_\_, \_\_, \_\_, J, \_\_, \_\_ \]
- G must speak before lunch, so G must be in one of the first three positions.
- F speaks in the first or third place. So, F can be in position 1 or 3.
- Only one speaker is between M and N. This means M and N must be in positions like (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), or (4, 6).
Given J is in position 4, M and N cannot be in (2, 4) or (4, 6). So, M and N must be in (1, 3) or (3, 5).
Let's consider the possibilities:
1. **If F is in position 1:**
   - The order is: \[ F, \_\_, \_\_, J, \_\_, \_\_ \]
   - G must be in position 2 or 3.
   - If G is in position 2, then M and N must be in (3, 5) or (5, 3).
     - If M is in 3, N is in 5: \[ F, G, M, J, N, \_\_ \]
     - If N is in 3, M is in 5: \[ F, G, N, J, M, \_\_ \]
   - If G is in position 3, then M and N must be in (1, 3) or (5, 3), but M and N cannot be in (1, 3) because F is in 1.
     - So, M is in 5, N is in 3: \[ F, \_\_, N, J, M, \_\_ \]
2. **If F is in position 3:**
   - The order is: \[ \_\_, \_\_, F, J, \_\_, \_\_ \]
   - G must be in position 1 or 2.
   - If G is in position 1, then M and N must be in (2, 5) or (5, 2).
     - If M is in 2, N is in 5: \[ G, M, F, J, N, \_\_ \]
     - If N is in 2, M is in 5: \[ G, N, F, J, M, \_\_ \]
   - If G is in position 2, then M and N must be in (1, 5) or (5, 1).
     - If M is in 1, N is in 5: \[ M, G, F, J, N, \_\_ \]
     - If N is in 1, M is in 5: \[ N, G, F, J, M, \_\_ \]
From these possibilities, the only consistent position for the third speaker is F or M.

","To determine which statement cannot weaken the argument, let's analyze each choice:
1. **Argument Summary**: The argument claims that for a government to meet the real needs of the people, it must know those needs, which can be ensured through freedom of expression. Therefore, free speech is essential for a healthy country.
2. **Choice A**: ""In most cases, the people do not know what they really need.""
   - This weakens the argument by suggesting that even if the government hears demands through free speech, those demands may not reflect the real needs.
3. **Choice B**: ""Free speech ultimately tends to disrupt social order, and good social order is a prerequisite for meeting the needs of the masses.""
   - This weakens the argument by implying that free speech could hinder the government's ability to meet needs due to social disruption.
4. **Choice C**: ""The legitimate function of the government is not to satisfy the needs of the people, but to provide equal opportunities for the people.""
   - This weakens the argument by challenging the premise that the government's role is to meet the needs of the people.
5. **Choice D**: ""Freedom of expression is insufficient to satisfy the needs of the masses, and good social order is also essential.""
   - This weakens the argument by suggesting that free speech alone is not enough and that social order is also necessary.
The statement that cannot weaken the argument is the one that does not challenge the necessity of free speech for the government to meet the needs of the people.

1. At least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited.
2. If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.
3. If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.
4. Only when you cross the I peak can you reach Lake J.
The team does not go to I Peak. According to condition 4, if they don't go to I Peak, they cannot visit Lake J. Therefore, they must visit Lake G to satisfy condition 1 (at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited).
Since they must visit Lake G, according to condition 2, they must visit either E city or F city (or both) because if they don't visit E or F, they can't visit G lake.
Now, let's evaluate the choices:
A: The group went to E city and J lake.
   - This cannot be true because they cannot visit Lake J without going to I Peak.
B: The group went to city E instead of city F.
   - This is not necessarily true. They could visit either E, F, or both.
C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain.
   - This is possible, but not necessarily true. They must visit G Lake, but visiting H Mountain depends on whether they visit E city.
D: The group went to F city and G lake tour.
   - This must be true. They must visit G Lake, and to do so, they must visit either E city or F city (or both). Since they cannot visit Lake J, they must visit G Lake, and visiting F city satisfies the condition for visiting G Lake.

","To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions and the current composition of the groups:
1. **Current Composition:**
   - Printing Group: F, H, L, M
   - Binding Group: G, H, J
2. **Conditions:**
   - Each group has at least 3 employees.
   - F and K cannot be in the same group.
   - If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group.
   - M is at least one of the members of these two groups.
   - At least one of the same employees in both groups.
3. **Analysis:**
   - **Condition 2:** F and K cannot be in the same group. Therefore, K cannot replace F in the Printing Group.
   - **Condition 3:** If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Therefore, K can only replace a member in the Binding Group if J is already in that group.
   - **Condition 5:** At least one of the same employees in both groups. Currently, H is in both groups.
4. **Replacement Possibilities:**
   - **Replace F:** Not possible due to Condition 2.
   - **Replace G:** If K replaces G in the Binding Group, the group becomes K, H, J. This satisfies all conditions:
     - Each group has at least 3 members.
     - K and J are both in the Binding Group, satisfying Condition 3.
     - H remains in both groups, satisfying Condition 5.
   - **Replace H:** If K replaces H in either group, the condition of having at least one common member in both groups (Condition 5) would be violated.
   - **Replace L:** If K replaces L in the Printing Group, the group becomes K, H, M. This violates Condition 3 because J is not in the Printing Group.
