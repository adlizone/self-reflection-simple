Identify the city where the university is located.\n2. Identify the state where the university is located.\n3. Count the number of letters in the name of the city.\n4. Count the number of letters in the name of the state.\n5. Multiply the number of letters in the city by the number of letters in the state.\n6. Work step-by-step through your mathematical calculations.\n7. Double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.\n8. Choose the answer that matches your calculated result.\nAdvice:\n - Always read the question carefully and understand the problem.\n - Always decompose complex problems into multiple simple steps.\n - Always think through each subproblem step-by-step.\n - Never skip any steps; be explicit in each step of your reasoning.\n - Always double-check your calculations and final answer.\n - Remember that the product of two numbers is the result of multiplying them together, not adding them."

It implies that to succeed in market competition, a company must excel in at least one of these areas.\n- Option A suggests that excelling in at least one area is necessary to gain a foothold in the market.\n- Option B implies that lacking any competitive advantage likely leads to losing out.\n- Option C suggests that excelling in one area guarantees huge profits, which is not stated in the paragraph.\n- Option D implies that without excelling in at least one area, success is impossible, which aligns closely with the paragraph's implication.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: C"
