(1) Each speaker speaks only once, and only once at the same time By.(2) Three speakers speak before lunch, and the other three speak after lunch.(3) G must speak before lunch.(4) Only one speaker is between M and N.(5) F speaks in the first or third place.\nQuestion: If J is the fourth speaker, who must be the third speaker?\nChoices:\n  A: F or M\n  C: L or N\n  B: G or L\n  D: M or N\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to arrange the speakers according to the given conditions:\n1. There are 6 speakers: F, G, J, L, M, and N.\n2. Three speakers speak before lunch, and three speak after lunch.\n3. G must speak before lunch.\n4. Only one speaker is between M and N.\n5. F speaks in the first or third place.\n6. J is the fourth speaker.\nLet's analyze the conditions:\n- Since J is the fourth speaker, the order is: \\[ \\_\\_, \\_\\_, \\_\\_, J, \\_\\_, \\_\\_ \\]\n- G must speak before lunch, so G must be in one of the first three positions.\n- F speaks in the first or third place. So, F can be in position 1 or 3.\n- Only one speaker is between M and N. This means M and N must be in positions like (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), or (4, 6).\nGiven J is in position 4, M and N cannot be in (2, 4) or (4, 6). So, M and N must be in (1, 3) or (3, 5).\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n1. **If F is in position 1:**\n   - The order is: \\[ F, \\_\\_, \\_\\_, J, \\_\\_, \\_\\_ \\]\n   - G must be in position 2 or 3.\n   - If G is in position 2, then M and N must be in (3, 5) or (5, 3).\n     - If M is in 3, N is in 5: \\[ F, G, M, J, N, \\_\\_ \\]\n     - If N is in 3, M is in 5: \\[ F, G, N, J, M, \\_\\_ \\]\n   - If G is in position 3, then M and N must be in (1, 3) or (5, 3), but M and N cannot be in (1, 3) because F is in 1.\n     - So, M is in 5, N is in 3: \\[ F, \\_\\_, N, J, M, \\_\\_ \\]\n2. **If F is in position 3:**\n   - The order is: \\[ \\_\\_, \\_\\_, F, J, \\_\\_, \\_\\_ \\]\n   - G must be in position 1 or 2.\n   - If G is in position 1, then M and N must be in (2, 5) or (5, 2).\n     - If M is in 2, N is in 5: \\[ G, M, F, J, N, \\_\\_ \\]\n     - If N is in 2, M is in 5: \\[ G, N, F, J, M, \\_\\_ \\]\n   - If G is in position 2, then M and N must be in (1, 5) or (5, 1).\n     - If M is in 1, N is in 5: \\[ M, G, F, J, N, \\_\\_ \\]\n     - If N is in 1, M is in 5: \\[ N, G, F, J, M, \\_\\_ \\]\nFrom these possibilities, the only consistent position for the third speaker is F or M.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")\n\n --- \nCorrect Answer: D"
