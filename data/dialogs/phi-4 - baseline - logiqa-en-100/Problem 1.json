However, the context specifies access to higher education through fair competition, not guaranteed access for everyone, so this is not necessarily unreasonable.\n- Option B suggests that guaranteeing compulsory education makes an education system reasonable. While compulsory education is a requirement, the context also requires fair access to higher education, so this alone does not make the system reasonable.\n- Option C states that not allowing everyone to enjoy compulsory education makes an education system unreasonable. This aligns with the context, as compulsory education is a requirement for a reasonable system.\n- Option D suggests more requirements are needed, but the context already specifies two key requirements for reasonableness.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
