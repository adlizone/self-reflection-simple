We need to find an explanation that accounts for why seals are affected but some people are not.\n- Option A suggests the fish itself is not harmed, which doesn't explain the difference in effects between seals and people.\n- Option B suggests that the toxic chemicals are concentrated in parts of the fish that seals eat but people do not, which directly explains why seals are poisoned and people are not.\n- Option C suggests traces of the chemical are found in people who didn't eat the fish, which doesn't address the contradiction.\n- Option D suggests the contaminated fish is only a small part of the seals' diet, which doesn't explain why seals are poisoned and people are not.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
