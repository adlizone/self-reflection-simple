Therefore, K cannot replace F in the Printing Group.\n   - **Condition 3:** If K is in a certain group, J must also be in this group. Therefore, K can only replace a member in the Binding Group if J is already in that group.\n   - **Condition 5:** At least one of the same employees in both groups. Currently, H is in both groups.\n4. **Replacement Possibilities:**\n   - **Replace F:** Not possible due to Condition 2.\n   - **Replace G:** If K replaces G in the Binding Group, the group becomes K, H, J. This satisfies all conditions:\n     - Each group has at least 3 members.\n     - K and J are both in the Binding Group, satisfying Condition 3.\n     - H remains in both groups, satisfying Condition 5.\n   - **Replace H:** If K replaces H in either group, the condition of having at least one common member in both groups (Condition 5) would be violated.\n   - **Replace L:** If K replaces L in the Printing Group, the group becomes K, H, M. This violates Condition 3 because J is not in the Printing Group.\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - K can replace G in the Binding Group without violating any conditions.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
