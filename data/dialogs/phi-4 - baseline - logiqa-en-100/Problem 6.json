If you don't go to E city or F city, you can't go to G lake.\n3. If you don't go to E city, you can't go to H mountain.\n4. Only when you cross the I peak can you reach Lake J.\nThe team does not go to I Peak. According to condition 4, if they don't go to I Peak, they cannot visit Lake J. Therefore, they must visit Lake G to satisfy condition 1 (at least one of Lake G and Lake J should be visited).\nSince they must visit Lake G, according to condition 2, they must visit either E city or F city (or both) because if they don't visit E or F, they can't visit G lake.\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\nA: The group went to E city and J lake.\n   - This cannot be true because they cannot visit Lake J without going to I Peak.\nB: The group went to city E instead of city F.\n   - This is not necessarily true. They could visit either E, F, or both.\nC: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain.\n   - This is possible, but not necessarily true. They must visit G Lake, but visiting H Mountain depends on whether they visit E city.\nD: The group went to F city and G lake tour.\n   - This must be true. They must visit G Lake, and to do so, they must visit either E city or F city (or both). Since they cannot visit Lake J, they must visit G Lake, and visiting F city satisfies the condition for visiting G Lake.\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
