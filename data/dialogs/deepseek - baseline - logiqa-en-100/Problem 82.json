To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that challenges the assumption that the house is a small-property house or that it is not protected by law.\nOption A suggests that the house has been tacitly approved by relevant departments, which could imply that it is protected by law despite being a small-property house. This directly weakens the argument.\nOption B reinforces the argument by confirming that the house is a small-property house.\nOption C does not directly address whether the house is protected by law or not.\nOption D suggests that some houses in Hexi Village are not small-property houses, but it does not specifically address the status of the newly built house in question.\nTherefore, the most effective choice to weaken the argument is A.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
