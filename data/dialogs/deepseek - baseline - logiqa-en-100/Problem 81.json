To support this, we need evidence that directly links higher oxygen levels to larger insect sizes.\n- **A**: This option discusses invertebrates in the ocean, not insects, and does not directly support the argument about oxygen content determining insect size.  \n- **B**: This option provides historical evidence that during a period with higher oxygen levels (35%), there were giant insects. This directly supports the argument.  \n- **C**: This option discusses the survival of locusts in low-oxygen environments but does not directly link oxygen content to insect size.  \n- **D**: This option shows that fruit flies increased in size under high oxygen conditions, which supports the argument but is less direct than historical evidence.  \nThe best support for the argument is **B**, as it provides historical evidence of larger insects during a period of higher oxygen levels.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
