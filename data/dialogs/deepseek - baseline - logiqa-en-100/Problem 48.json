To counter this, we need to show that the increase in transaction volume does not necessarily mean more individuals are involved. The first option states that although the turnover has increased by 23%, the volume of Chinese buyers has not increased this year. This directly challenges the argument by suggesting that the same number of buyers could be responsible for the higher transaction volume, possibly due to larger individual purchases rather than an increase in the number of wealthy individuals transferring property.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
