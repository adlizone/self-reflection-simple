The context mentions that the price increase exceeded the bank deposit interest rate, and the growth rate of residents' savings deposits declined. This suggests that residents are seeking higher returns than what bank deposits offer.\nOption A suggests that residents are keeping funds liquid to buy goods due to expected price rises, but this does not explain the outflow of funds from savings accounts.\nOption B suggests that residents are waiting for an expected increase in bank interest rates, but this would likely lead to an increase in savings deposits, not an outflow.\nOption C suggests that private lending is active due to tight funds for private enterprises, and the interest on lending is much higher than bank deposit interest rates. This would explain why residents are moving their funds out of savings accounts to seek higher returns through private lending.\nOption D suggests that residents are considering buying stocks or funds due to low bank deposit interest rates, but this does not directly explain the outflow of funds as clearly as Option C.\nThe best explanation is Option C, as it directly addresses the pursuit of higher returns through private lending, which aligns with the context of the outflow of savings funds.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
