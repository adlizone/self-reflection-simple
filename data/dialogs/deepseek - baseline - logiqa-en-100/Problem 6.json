From constraint (4), if the team does not go to I Peak, they cannot reach Lake J. So, Lake J is not visited.\n3. From constraint (1), at least one of Lake G or Lake J must be visited. Since Lake J is not visited, Lake G must be visited.\n4. From constraint (2), if Lake G is visited, the team must visit either City E or City F.\n5. From constraint (3), if the team does not visit City E, they cannot visit Mountain H. However, the question does not provide information about whether Mountain H is visited, so we cannot conclude anything about Mountain H.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- **A: The group went to E city and J lake**  \n  This is false because the team cannot visit Lake J (due to not visiting I Peak).\n- **B: The group went to city E instead of city F**  \n  This is not necessarily true because the team could visit either City E or City F to satisfy constraint (2).\n- **C: The group went to visit G Lake and H Mountain**  \n  This is not necessarily true because there is no information about whether Mountain H is visited.\n- **D: The group went to F city and G lake tour**  \n  This is possible because the team must visit Lake G and could visit City F to satisfy constraint (2).\nThe only option that must be true is **D**, as the team must visit Lake G and could visit City F.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
