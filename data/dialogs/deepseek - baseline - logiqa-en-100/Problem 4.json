F must be in the first or third place. If F is in the first place, the third place must be either M or N to satisfy the condition that only one speaker is between M and N. If F is in the third place, the first place must be G, and the second place must be either M or N. Therefore, the third speaker must be either M or N.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
