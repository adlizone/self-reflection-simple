Let's evaluate each choice:\nA: This challenges the argument by pointing out a circular reasoning issue, as it presupposes the existence of the external world to explain sensory evidence. This constitutes a doubt or rebuttal.\nB: This questions the assumption that others have similar visual experiences, which is a key part of the argument. This constitutes a doubt or rebuttal.\nC: This statement does not challenge the argument. Instead, it supports the reliability of visual experience by claiming that even mirages are real. This does not constitute a doubt or rebuttal.\nD: This questions the argument by suggesting that the success of natural science could be explained without the existence of an external world. This constitutes a doubt or rebuttal.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
