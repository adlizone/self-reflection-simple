To support this, we need evidence that directly links the micro-shocks to improved mathematical ability. \n- **A**: This option discusses the cost and painlessness of the stimulus but does not directly support the claim that it improves computing power.  \n- **B**: This option suggests a temporary enhancement in blood flow between neurons, but it does not directly link this to improved mathematical ability or computing power.  \n- **C**: This option establishes that the two groups were comparable in mathematical ability before the experiment, which strengthens the validity of the results by ruling out pre-existing differences.  \n- **D**: This option suggests that the micro-shocks may have improved focus, which could indirectly explain the improved test results, but it does not directly support the claim that the micro-shocks improved computing power.  \nThe best choice is **C**, as it directly supports the validity of the experiment by showing that the groups were comparable before the intervention, making the results more credible.  \nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
