Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following item is true, can the argument be strengthened most?\nChoices:\n  A: The cost and selling price of \"Inferno\" are lower than that of \"Harbour\".\n  B: The above advertisers who refused to renew their contracts have not affected the benefits after switching to other publications.\n  C: Readers of family magazines are generally not interested in violent and pornographic content.\n  D: Some clients who advertise in other family magazines and so on turn to \"Inferno\" magazine.\n"

To strengthen this argument, we need evidence that supports the idea that ethical considerations influenced their decision. \n- **A**: This does not strengthen the argument because it focuses on cost and price, not ethics.  \n- **B**: This strengthens the argument because it shows that the advertisers' decision to leave was not driven by economic loss, suggesting ethical concerns were the primary factor.  \n- **C**: This does not directly strengthen the argument because it focuses on reader preferences, not advertiser ethics.  \n- **D**: This weakens the argument because it suggests that some advertisers are willing to support \"Inferno,\" which contradicts the idea of ethical responsibility.  \nThe best choice to strengthen the argument is **B**.  \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
