Since it picked up squares, it must be able to recognize shapes, so it cannot be type C. It also picked up red squares, so it must be able to recognize colors, meaning it cannot be type B. Therefore, Robot 1 must be type A.\n2. **Robot 2** picked up the blue balls. Since it picked up balls, it must be able to recognize shapes, so it cannot be type C. It also picked up blue balls, so it must be able to recognize colors, meaning it cannot be type B. Therefore, Robot 2 must be type A.\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n- **A: Both No.1 and No.2 are type C.** This is false because both robots can recognize shapes and colors, so they cannot be type C.\n- **B: Only one of No.1 and No.2 is C type.** This is false because neither robot is type C.\n- **C: No.1 is type A and No.2 is type B.** This is false because Robot 2 must also be type A, not type B.\n- **D: No.1 is not Type B and No.2 is not Type A.** This is false because Robot 1 is not type B (it is type A), but Robot 2 is type A, so the second part of the statement is incorrect.\nNone of the options are entirely correct based on the analysis. However, the closest option is **D**, as it correctly states that Robot 1 is not type B, even though the second part is incorrect.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
