The administration department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- **Option A**: Finance (1), Planning (2), Administration (3), Human Resources (4), R & D (5), Sales (6). This satisfies all constraints: HR and Sales are not adjacent, Finance is next to Planning, and Administration is above Planning but below HR.\n- **Option B**: Finance (1), Planning (2), Administration (3), Human Resources (4), Sales (5), R & D (6). This violates the first constraint because HR and Sales are adjacent.\n- **Option C**: Planning (1), Finance (2), Sales (3), R & D (4), Administration (5), Human Resources (6). This violates the third constraint because Administration is not above Planning.\n- **Option D**: Sales (1), Finance (2), Planning (3), R & D (4), Human Resources (5), Administration (6). This violates the third constraint because Administration is not below HR.\nThe only option that satisfies all constraints is **Option A**.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
