Most people think that advertisers do whatever they can to attract customers.But advertisers are not always like this.Recently, in order to expand sales, a family magazine called \"Bay\" was renamed \"Inferno\", which mainly published violent and pornographic content.As a result, some perennial advertisers from the original \"Bay\" magazine refused to renew the contract and turned to other publications.This shows that these advertisers not only consider economic benefits, but also take into account their ethical responsibilities.\nQuestion: If the following items are true, they can weaken the above argument, except\nChoices:\n  A: The violent and pornographic content published in Purgatory magazine is more moderate in similar magazines.\n  B: Magazines that publish violent and pornographic content usually sell well, but have low credibility.\n  C: The above-mentioned advertisers who refused to renew their contracts mainly promoted household goods.\n  D: The advertising cost of the purgatory magazine after the name change is several times higher than before the name change.\n"

To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that provides an alternative reason for the advertisers' decision, not related to ethics.\n- **A**: This suggests the content is moderate, which does not directly weaken the argument about ethical concerns.  \n- **B**: This implies that advertisers might have left due to low credibility, not ethics, weakening the argument.  \n- **C**: This suggests advertisers promoted household goods, which might not align with violent/pornographic content, but it does not directly weaken the ethical argument.  \n- **D**: This provides a financial reason (higher advertising costs) for advertisers leaving, weakening the ethical argument.  \nThe option that does not weaken the argument is **A**, as it does not provide an alternative reason for the advertisers' decision.  \nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
