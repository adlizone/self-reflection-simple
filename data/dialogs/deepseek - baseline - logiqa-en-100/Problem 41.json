It also mentions that if it achieves a 10% increase, it can achieve a 20% increase. However, the key point is that a 10% increase is necessary to avoid bankruptcy, not necessarily a 20% increase. Let's evaluate the options:\nA: This is not necessarily true because the context does not state that failing to achieve a 20% increase leads to bankruptcy. Only failing to achieve a 10% increase leads to bankruptcy.\nB: This is true because if Green Island increases productivity by 20%, it has already achieved the necessary 10% increase to avoid bankruptcy.\nC: This is not necessarily true because the context does not provide information about what would happen if the market does not change.\nD: This is not necessarily true because the context states that achieving a 10% increase makes it possible to achieve a 20% increase.\nThe correct answer is B because it aligns with the information provided in the context.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
