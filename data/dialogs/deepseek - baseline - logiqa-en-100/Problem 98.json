We need to find an option that supports this argument.\n- **A**: This suggests that following regulations is necessary to judge right and wrong, which contradicts the argument that right and wrong are independent of regulations. This weakens the argument.\n- **B**: This introduces a religious perspective but does not directly address the relationship between regulations and moral judgments. It neither supports nor weakens the argument.\n- **C**: This implies that rules or standards are always behind judgments of right and wrong, which aligns with the idea that regulations and moral judgments are intertwined. This supports the argument.\n- **D**: This emphasizes that moral conscience is universal, but regulations vary, which aligns with the argument that regulations can sometimes conflict with moral judgments. This supports the argument.\nBoth **C** and **D** support the argument, but **D** more directly aligns with the idea that regulations and moral judgments can differ.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
