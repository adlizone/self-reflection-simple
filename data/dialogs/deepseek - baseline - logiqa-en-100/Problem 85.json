This eliminates any scenarios involving E.\n2. **Constraint (1)**: If E is used, F cannot be used and K must be used. Since E is not used, this constraint does not directly affect the other papers.\n3. **Constraint (2)**: Paper G or H can only be used without J. This means if G or H is used, J cannot be used, and vice versa.\n4. **Constraint (3)**: If G is not used, K is not used. This means K can only be used if G is used.\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n- **Option A**: Paper E is used, but paper H is not used. This is invalid because E cannot be used (Constraint 4).\n- **Option B**: Both articles G and H are used. This is invalid because Constraint (2) states that G or H can only be used without J, but it does not prevent both G and H from being used together. However, this option does not necessarily follow from the constraints.\n- **Option C**: No paper J, but paper K. This is possible. If J is not used, G or H can be used (Constraint 2). If G is used, K can also be used (Constraint 3).\n- **Option D**: Both G and J articles are unnecessary. This is possible. If G is not used, K is not used (Constraint 3), and J can be used or not used independently.\nThe option that must be true based on the constraints is **Option C**, as it aligns with the rules and is a necessary outcome.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
