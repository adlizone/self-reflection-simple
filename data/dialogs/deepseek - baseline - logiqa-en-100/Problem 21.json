At present, part of the orbit of Comet 1996D3 is far from the sun, but recently it can be found to emit flickering light through the solar telescope.In the past, people never observed such flashes of comets far away from the sun, so this flicker must be an unusual scene.Xiao Wang? Normally people don't observe comets far away from the sun.The 1996D3 comet flicker light discovered this time was obtained by continuous and careful tracking observation.\nQuestion: Which of the following most accurately summarizes the method Xiao Wang used to refute Xiao Chen's views?\nChoices:\n  A: Point out that the key concepts used by Xiao Chen are ambiguous.\n  B: pointed out that Xiao Chen's argument is clearly lacking in persuasion.\n  C: pointed out that Xiao Chen's arguments contradict themselves.\n  D: Disagree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, and put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.E.Agree with Xiao Chen's conclusion, but put forward another explanation for Xiao Chen's argument.\n"

Xiao Wang counters this by stating that people normally don't observe comets far from the sun, and the flicker was discovered through continuous and careful tracking observation. Xiao Wang is not pointing out ambiguity, lack of persuasion, or contradiction in Xiao Chen's argument. Instead, Xiao Wang is disagreeing with Xiao Chen's conclusion and providing an alternative explanation: the flicker was observed due to continuous and careful tracking, not because it is unusual. This aligns with option D.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
