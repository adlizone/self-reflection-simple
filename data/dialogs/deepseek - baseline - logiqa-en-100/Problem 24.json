This is a sampling bias, as the sample is not representative of the broader population of intellectuals. The correct answer should highlight this issue.\n- **A**: This option focuses on the reliability of the sample data but does not address the broader issue of sampling bias.\n- **B**: This option suggests increasing the sample size but does not directly address the fallacy of generalizing from a specific group to all intellectuals.\n- **C**: This option effectively points out the fallacy by comparing it to a similar flawed reasoning (surveying college students' average age of death and generalizing it to all people with college education). This highlights the sampling bias issue.\n- **D**: This option mentions the lack of distinction between types of intellectuals but does not directly address the core fallacy of sampling bias.\nThe most accurate answer is **C**, as it directly points out the fallacy of generalizing from a specific group to a broader population.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
