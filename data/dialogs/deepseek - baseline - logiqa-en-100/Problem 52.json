It also establishes an inverse relationship between cost and profit: higher cost leads to lower profit, and higher profit leads to lower cost. This implies a conflict of interest between the boss and employees because increasing wages (cost) reduces profit, and vice versa.\nNow, let’s evaluate the choices:\n- **A**: Employees holding shares does not directly address the conflict of interest described in the context. The conflict arises from the cost-profit relationship, not shareholding.\n- **B**: If employees hold shares, they might benefit from profits, aligning their interests with the boss. This could reduce the conflict of interest, making this a plausible conclusion.\n- **C**: If employees do not hold shares, their interests (higher wages) directly conflict with the boss’s interest (higher profit). This is strongly supported by the context.\n- **D**: The context does not provide information about the relative earnings of the boss and employees, so this cannot be concluded.\nThe most strongly supported conclusion is **C**, as it directly aligns with the conflict of interest described in the context.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
