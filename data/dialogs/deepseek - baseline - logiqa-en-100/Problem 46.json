Therefore, G must be in either public relations or sales.\nNow, let's evaluate the pairs:\n- **A: G and I**  \n  G and I could both be in sales, as there are no constraints preventing this.\n- **B: G and X**  \n  G and X could both be in sales, but if X is in sales, W must be in production (constraint 3). This is still possible.\n- **C: G and Y**  \n  If G and Y are in sales, then H must also be in sales (since H and Y must be in the same department). However, this would mean 4 people are in sales (G, Y, H, and one more), which exceeds the limit of 3. Therefore, this pair is unlikely.\n- **D: H and W**  \n  H and W could both be in sales, as long as Y is also in sales (since H and Y must be in the same department). This is possible.\nThus, the pair that is unlikely to be assigned to the sales department is **G and Y**.\nAction: Answer(\"C\")"
