If a company has dividends, it does not need financing. If it needs financing, it does not have dividends. So, this statement cannot be false.\n   - **B: A listed company needs financing, or a company without dividends.**\n     - This is not necessarily true. A company could have dividends and not need financing, which would make this statement false.\n   - **C: A listed company does not need to issue new stocks, or is not a company with dividends.**\n     - This is not necessarily true. A company with dividends could issue new stocks, which would make this statement false.\n   - **D: The only way for a listed company to finance is to issue new stocks.**\n     - This is not necessarily true. The premises do not state that issuing new stocks is the only way to finance.\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only statement that cannot be false is **A**.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
