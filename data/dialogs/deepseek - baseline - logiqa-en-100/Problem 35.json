This is **false**.  \n**B: Wang, Zhao, and Liu were all hired by Tianji.**  \n- This is possible because Liu and Zhao are in the same unit, and Wang could also be in Tianji. This is **correct**.  \n**C: Only Liu was hired by Tianxuan.**  \n- If Liu → Tianxuan, then Zhao → Tianxuan (from point 3). This contradicts \"Only Liu.\" This is **false**.  \n**D: Only Wang was hired by Tianxuan.**  \n- This is possible if Zhang is not in Tianxuan, and Wang is the only one in Tianxuan. This is **correct**.  \nBoth **B** and **D** are possible, but since the question asks for \"which of the following may be correct,\" we need to choose the most directly supported option. **B** is more explicitly supported by the given information.  \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
