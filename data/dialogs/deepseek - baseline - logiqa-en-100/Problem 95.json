He highlights how small issues can become significant when multiplied by the population, and large totals can seem small when divided by the population. This underscores the complexity of managing China's affairs due to its population size.\nOption A focuses on the difficulty of living a good life but does not directly address the complexity of managing China's affairs.  \nOption B directly aligns with the idea that China's large population makes its affairs complicated and arduous, which is the core message of Premier Wen's statement.  \nOption C mentions China's development tasks but shifts focus to the idea of threatening other countries, which is not the main point of the statement.  \nOption D is a proverb about collective effort and does not relate to the context of the statement.  \nThe closest option is B, as it captures the essence of the complexity and challenges posed by China's large population.\nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
