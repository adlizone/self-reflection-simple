Let's analyze the options:\nA: \"Only those who do what they want can do it to others.\" This is not a logical inference because the original statement does not imply that only those who do what they want can impose it on others. It simply advises against imposing unwanted actions on others.\nB: \"If you want, then give it to others.\" This is not a logical inference because the original statement does not suggest that if you want something, you should give it to others. It focuses on avoiding actions you do not want for yourself.\nC: \"Don't treat others unless you want to.\" This is not a logical inference because the original statement does not imply that you should only treat others if you want to. It advises against treating others in ways you would not want to be treated.\nD: \"Whatever is applied to people should be what they want.\" This is not a logical inference because the original statement does not suggest that everything applied to people should be what they want. It only advises against imposing what you do not want on others.\nThe option that is not a logical inference from the original statement is A, as it introduces a condition that is not present in the original statement.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
