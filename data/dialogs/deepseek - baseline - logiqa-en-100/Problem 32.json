This directly contradicts the statement in A, which claims that being careful means having no taste. Therefore, A cannot be derived from the context.\n- **B**: The context mentions that being overbearing is associated with immorality. This aligns with B, so B can be derived from the context.\n- **C**: The context explicitly states that plundering nature leads to unsustainable life. This aligns with C, so C can be derived from the context.\n- **D**: The context does not link being careful with immorality or overbearing behavior. Therefore, D cannot be derived from the context.\nHowever, the question asks for the choice that **cannot** be derived. Both A and D cannot be derived, but since we must choose one, A is the more direct contradiction.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
