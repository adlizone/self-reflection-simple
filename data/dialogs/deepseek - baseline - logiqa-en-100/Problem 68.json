For the argument to hold, it must assume that a person can accurately predict how long they will live before deciding whether to steal. This is because the argument hinges on the idea that the fear of being caught is a deterrent for those who expect to live longer. Without this assumption, the argument falls apart because the reasoning relies on the person's ability to assess their lifespan.\nAction: Answer(\"A\")"
