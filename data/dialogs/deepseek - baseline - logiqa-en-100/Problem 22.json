Let's analyze each option:\nA: This explains the gap by suggesting that the CPI statistical range and standards are outdated and may not accurately reflect current price trends. This is relevant.\nB: This explains the gap by stating that the CPI is a national average and may not capture individual or regional differences. This is relevant.\nC: This explains the gap by pointing out that essential goods (high relevance) tend to increase in price, while non-essential goods (low relevance) tend to decrease. This is relevant.\nD: This does not explain the gap. It only states that high-income groups are less sensitive to small price increases, which does not address why the CPI and people's feelings differ.\nAction: Answer(\"D\")"
