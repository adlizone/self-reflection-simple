        "content": "Thought: \nThe assertion is that rising land prices are the chief culprit in soaring housing prices. To doubt this assertion, we need evidence that shows housing prices rose significantly even when land prices did not rise significantly. \n- **A**: Shanghai's housing prices increased by 19.1%, while land prices rose by 6.53%. This shows a correlation between rising land prices and housing prices, supporting the assertion.  \n- **B**: Beijing's housing prices increased by 7.2%, while land prices rose by only 0.37%. This suggests that housing prices can rise significantly even when land prices do not, which casts doubt on the assertion.  \n- **C**: The chairman's opinion supports the assertion that rising land prices lead to higher housing prices.  \n- **D**: The chairman's statement attributes rising housing prices to supply and demand, not land prices, which also casts doubt on the assertion.  \nBetween **B** and **D**, **B** provides concrete data that directly contradicts the assertion, making it the most doubtful.  \nAction: Answer(\"B\")"
